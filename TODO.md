## TODO

### General

- Make it a Desktop App
[ ] Settings (eg toggle Auto Select)
    - Toggle Auto select for Agents
    - Start VALORANT on startup

### Frontend

Visual:
[x] Bigger, transparent Footer
[x] Make Scaling Responsive better so you can see all elements on the screen with lower resolution
[x] Open Skin Selection Modal in the Center
[ ] Prioritize Premium Skins
[x] Hover effects
[ ] Dark mode
[ ] Tray App
[ ] Create "Variants" for Presets so you don't have to change agents for every preset

UX:
[x] New Preset Button defaults to current loadout with no agents
[ ] Search bar in the skin selection
[ ] Little button on WeaponCard to change Variant
[ ] Ability to hide certain weapons
[ ] Ability rearrange the weapons (Drag & Drop)

### Backend

[ ] Apply loadout when agent selection time runs out
[x] Wait for VALORANT to start when starting 
[ ] Skin Randomizer
